# Weather App

## Comments

- `enableLocationView` has been created to showcase how to build a view without using Storyboards. However, the rest of the project has been developed using Storyboards and XIBs, as they are what I'm most accustomed to and allowed me to progress more quickly.

- No external libraries have been used, so there was no need for CocoaPods. In my opinion, it's generally better to rely on the tools provided by the Swift API, as it avoids dependency issues that may arise when migrating the app to a newer Swift version. However, in the part where obtaining the city name from the user's location, it could be improved by implementing a library that handles all possible cases. Unusual scenarios have been tested, such as locations in the northern part of Greenland, where the city name may not be available due to limited data.

- The `.xcconfig` file has been added to store the ApiKey, providing convenience for configuration purposes.
